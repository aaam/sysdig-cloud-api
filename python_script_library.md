A python client API for Sysdig Cloud.

This module is a wrapper around the Sysdig Cloud API, which is documented [here](http://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/205233166-The-Sysdig-Cloud-API-Specification). It exposes most of the sysdig REST API functionality as an easy to use and easy to install python interface. The repository includes a rich set of examples (in the [examples](examples/) subdir) that quickly address several use cases.
